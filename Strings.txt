Strings

String is the technical name for text. To define a block of code as a string, you need to include it in either double quotes("") or single quotes(''). It doesnt matter which one you use as long as you are consistent.

There are some characters you need to be particularly careful with when inputting them into strings. These include:
				
									" ' \

That is because these symbols have special meanings in Python and it can get confusing if you use them in a string.

If you want to use one of these symbols you need to precede it with a backslash symbol and then Python will know to ignore the symbol and will treat it as normal text that is to be displayed.
